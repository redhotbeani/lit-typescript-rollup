# lit-typescript-rollup

This is a Litelement Typescript project build with Rollup. Can be used as an example how to setup a Web Components project using Lit, Typescript and Rollup.

I created this project because I couldn't find a good online example using only Rollup.

## Usage

1. Install packages
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```
3. Start a development build
   ```sh
   yarn start
   ```
3. Or do a production build
	```sh
	yarn build
	```
